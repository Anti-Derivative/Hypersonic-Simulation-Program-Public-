Before running the simulation, the workspace must be preloaded for data, double click backupdata.mat or enter the command:
load('backupdata.mat')

Set the initial conditions for launch from the integrator blocks.

Define the ideal dynamic pressure to operate at.

Set appropriate climb and descent flight path angles, or add a predefined flight path angle file in timestamp format to feed towards the gamdoti block.
